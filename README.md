# Quiz Game

# Project Description
QuizGameFinal is a simple quiz game application built using Java Swing for the GUI and MySQL for the database. Users can create their own quizzes, select categories, and answer questions. With this project I hope I can help fellow students to study for their upcoming exams/quizzes by letting the user define their own questions and answers.
